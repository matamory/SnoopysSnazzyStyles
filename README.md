# SnoopysSnazzyStyles

Overview

Snoopy’s Snazzy Styles is a medium scale dog grooming company in need of an interactive website that allows employees to seamlessly update their internal data and schedule appointments. Some challenges currently faced by the company include accidental double bookings, lack of remote access to schedules, and poor organization of some client data such as grooming preferences/history. The company currently has 10 active employees who can serve 2-8 dogs a day each depending on client needs and dog size. They currently have approximately 1500 clients and need a database driven website that allows employees to schedule client appointments, cancel client appointments, add new clients and dogs, update employee schedules, and retrieve client and scheduling information. Utilizing this approach will allow Snoopy’s Snazzy Styles to maintain scalability and customer relations having quick access to customer information, history, and preferences. Future expansion of this website could entail the addition of usability features such as report generation or role based access protocols. However, these features remain out scope for this project given current constraints. 
The appointed scheduling system will be one of the more complex features. As such, here is a brief overview of the intended implementation. In order to schedule client appointments, a query will be run and visualized on the Schedules, Employees, and Sessions Tables. This query will join the three tables where the sessions scheduled during employee hours will be filtered and displayed as blocks of times that are available. Then, based on this knowledge, an employee can fill a simple form to submit a new entry to the Sessions table and update available time slots.
